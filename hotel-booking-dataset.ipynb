There are two main types of hotels based on location and the purpose of the visit, namely city hotels and resort hotels.\n\n### City Hotels¶\nExplanation: City hotels are typically located in city centers or business districts.

The main focus of resorts is to provide a relaxing stay complete with recreational facilities, such as swimming pools, spas, golf courses, and entertainment programs.\n\n\n## Business Problem\nIn recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, includinh fewer revenues and less than idea hotel room use. Consequently , lowering cancellation rates is both hotels'primery goal in order to increase their effciency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to address this problem.\nThe analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics if this report.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Import libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport warnings\n# Ignore all warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-01T17:32:06.902118Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-01T17:32:06.90248Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-01T17:32:06.908325Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-01T17:32:06.902448Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-01T17:32:06.906988Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Loading the dataset with df veriable\ndf=pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/hotel-booking-dataset/hotel_bookings.csv')","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-01T17:32:30.258025Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-01T17:32:30.258455Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-01T17:32:30.6289Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-01T17:32:30.258415Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-01T17:32:30.627799Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Explotry Data Analysis ,cleaning and visualization","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-01T17:32:46.307001Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-01T17:32:46.307435Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-01T17:32:46.350244Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-01T17:32:46.307399Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-01T17:32:46.349139Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.tail()","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.shape","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.columns","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.T\ndf.info()","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# \" reservation_status_date \" column has object data type , we will convert to DateTime data type\ndf['reservation_status_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['reservation_status_date'])","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info() # again check the data type","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.describe() # check the summary statistics of the numeric data","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# check the summery of all data type include object type\ndf.describe(include='object')","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.nunique()","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum() # check the missing values in the dataframe","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are the four columns have missing values, column 'company' and 'agent' we will remove.

As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.\n* 3. In the month of january , hotels can start compaigns or marketing with reasonable price to increase thier revenue as the cancelation is the hieghest in this month.\n* 4.
